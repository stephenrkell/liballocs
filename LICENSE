This is experimental research software! If you're interested in
licensing it, please contact me, the author, Stephen Kell
<stephen.kell@cl.cam.ac.uk>.

Software licensing is complicated; licensing of research software is
doubly so. If you care, please read my thoughts on this matter.
<http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~srk31/blog/2015/06/30#software-licenses>

Since people seem interested in using this software, as of the current
revision I am happy to license it under the terms of GNU Lesser General
Public License version 3, whose text is in the file LICENSE.lgpl3.

If you want it under a different license, please contact me.

Nothing about this licensing arrangement is final, nor exclusive of
other options. For example, I may be willing to license the software *to
you* on customised terms. And I may also change how I license subsequent
changes to the work. All this is in aid of maximising public good.

Another addendum: in the above I omitted to mention that separate
licensing terms apply to a few parts of the code, as commented in the
source file themselves. In particular, CIL tools (OCaml code in
tools/lang/c/*) are licensed under the same licence as CIL, and bear
comments to that effect.
