	 * trapping all mmaps, even our own, taking a "deferred approach" to initialization.
	 * In short, for any call that is "too early" for us to handle, we write it to
	 * a static buffer and process the buffer when we become fully initialized.
	 * Do we really have to trap our own syscalls, though? That seems drastic and runs
	 * counter to our approach thus far, where we are allowed to make syscalls unimpeded.
	 * Perhaps even without that, we can catch mmap calls made by musl or dlmalloc code?
