/* FIXME: currently we use a "trailer" at the end of the chunk, to store

 * BUT
 * finding the trailer requires a well-known (global) malloc_usable_size call, whereas
 * different allocators bring different metadata. So it should be a per-allocator
 * call.
 * Could use headers instead of trailers, but then this less extensible:
            the user's chunk base is now different from the allocator's, so
            other malloc API calls (mallinfo, etc.) on the same chunk no longer work
            unless we wrap them all.
 * The right way is probably to override malloc_usable_size() and dispatch
 * to the right allocator's... i.e. like dladdr and the libunwind functions,
 * this is a function that we not-so-secretly override with an 'improved',
 * more powerful version.

/* libmallochooks defines a bunch of 'events' into which it can
 * factor incoming malloc/calloc/realloc/free/... calls for
 * convenient instrumentation such as "pre_alloc", 
 * "post_nonnull_nonzero_realloc", and so on.
 * A client requests these hooks by building
 * a copy of 'event_hooks.c' in a suitably crafted preprocessor
 * environment, mostly defining __next_hook_*  -- usually as
 * __terminal_hook_*, which gives control back to the core
 * libmallochooks code, for dispatching to the actual function.
 * In libmallochooks there are a few different backends for doing
 * this dispatching, depending on how both the malloc and the hooks
 * are to be linked in: wrap for old-fashioned link-time wrapping,
 * preload for LD_PRELOAD, and wrapdl for our tricky case of 'two
 * layers of hooks' (caller-side and callee-side) in the malloc-in-
 * exe case. Preloading naturally supports two layers just fine
 * -- but ld --wrap using the hypothetical symbols __wrap___real_* and
 * __real___real_* doesn't quite work.
 *
 * Is it true that preloading handles two layers just fine? Sort of.
 * In what we preload, there is a caller element (snarfing the return
 * address, if a facade wrapper didn't set the thread-local) and a callee
 * element (actually doing the indexing). This works 
 * least in the cases we care about -- facade-in-client-exe,
 * malloc-in-DSO. In exotic cases it might not work.
 *
 * Do we want a
 * strict separation between caller-side and callee-side instrumentation?
 *
 * Do we ever generate a wrapper for immediate callers of a bona-fide
 * allocation function, like an in-exe malloc? Yes, in malloc-in-exe
 * we have 'make_caller_wrapper(malloc, p)' and so on.
 * Presumably, any code that calls malloc should call 
 
 * Another
 * issue is that our preloaded instrumentation provides a fallback
 * caller-side wrapper, by snarfing __builtin_return_address
 *
 * Since we implement these event hooks, include the header.
 * We also give the prototypes hidden visibility here, although that
 * relaly achieves little (visibility of the definition is much
 * more important; we also control that, of course). */

// from nonshared-hook-wrappers.c:
/* This is like the usual wrap hooks, except we use libdl to 
 * get the __real_ function. It's useful when the __real_ function
 * is itself link-time-wrapped (--wrap __real_malloc)
 * for insertion of another layer of wrappers. In such a situation,
 * a reference to __real_malloc would bind us back to the top-level
 * __wrap_malloc, and a reference to __real___real_malloc would bind
 * to __real_malloc which is an undefined symbol (it's never actually
 * defined). Attempts to --defsym __real_malloc don't work, because
 * they are themselves subject to wrapping: --defsym __real_malloc=malloc
 * will give us __wrap_malloc again.
 *
 * The fact that our terminating case uses libdl is now a source of the
 * usual problems: are we on a callchain from within libdl, e.g. dlsym()
 * doing its calloc()? If so, we should ourselves be sure not to call 
 * dlsym(). Two solutions suggest themselves: using our own dlsym() that never
 * allocates, or ensuring the first call through all these hooks (which
 * is the only one that should need dlsym()) does not itself come from dlsym. */
